## How it works
1. Chrome extension popup will sync data from your trading brockages
2. Trading data will be saved in chrome storage

4. Trading reports will be generated from the converted data


## Run the app
1. Clone this repo and run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev` for development mode
3. Run `npm run build` to build the Chrome extension
4. Import /dist folder in the Chrome extension page

## Dev setup
**Next js / Typescript / Tailwind**


## Dev issue
Content Security Policy (CSP), a security mechanism implemented by web browsers to mitigate certain types of attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).


## Project file structure
This project is following Next v13 structure with;
- pages/popup for the Chrome extension popup window
- the main app/ will be the main report app

```

  /chrome-services
  /popup
    popup.html
    popup.tsx
